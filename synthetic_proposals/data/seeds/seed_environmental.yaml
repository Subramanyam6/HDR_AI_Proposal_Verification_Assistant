work_approach:
  executive_summary: >
    Delta Eco Strategies will co-create a restoration roadmap grounded in community stewardship,
    adaptive modeling, and resilient monitoring to accelerate wetland recovery across the Gulf Coast.
  objectives:
    - Prioritize restoration reaches delivering habitat and storm surge benefits.
    - Implement long-term monitoring with remote sensing and field validation.
    - Align implementation sequencing with state and federal funding windows.
  constraints:
    - Subsidence and relative sea level rise outpacing restoration.
    - Interplay of multiple funding programs with distinct reporting.
    - Seasonal weather disruptions affecting fieldwork.
  success_factors:
    - Deep community partnerships and capacity building.
    - Data transparency with living dashboards and open datasets.
    - Integrated sediment management and shoreline stabilization strategies.
  elements:
    - id: E1
      title: Program Launch and Governance
      context: Establish collaborative governance, work plan, and risk mitigation.
      activities:
        - Form stakeholder advisory council with coastal parishes and tribes.
