  executive_summary: >
    Horizon Design Resources offers a staged delivery approach focusing on rapid deployment,
    stakeholder collaboration, and data-backed decision making to deliver a BRT corridor that
    improves travel time reliability and enhances equitable access.
  objectives:
    - Establish a corridor design responsive to future fleet electrification.
    - Achieve NEPA clearance within 18 months.
    - Coordinate construction phasing to maintain interim bus service.
  constraints:
    - Constrained right-of-way along downtown segments.
    - Utility conflicts with high pressure gas mains.
    - Aggressive project delivery timeline tied to grant cycles.
  success_factors:
    - Early mitigation of high-risk intersections.
    - Continuous quality oversight and documentation control.
    - Transparent coordination with business stakeholders.
