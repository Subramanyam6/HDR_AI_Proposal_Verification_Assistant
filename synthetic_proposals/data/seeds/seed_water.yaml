  executive_summary: >
    Cascadia Infrastructure Group will deliver a resilient floodplain strategy grounded in nature-based solutions,
    adaptive modeling, and inclusive engagement to mitigate flood risk while enhancing salmon habitat.
  objectives:
    - Integrate green infrastructure solutions for flood attenuation.
    - Modernize pump station operations with remote monitoring.
    - Align design alternatives with tribal co-management objectives.
  constraints:
    - Sea level rise projections beyond 2050.
    - Aging mechanical equipment with limited maintenance windows.
    - Multi-jurisdictional permitting requirements.
  success_factors:
    - Early coordination with regulatory agencies.
    - Scenario modeling across climate futures.
    - Meaningful engagement with tribal partners.
